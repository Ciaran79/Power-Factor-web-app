Power factor training is simply a way to record your progress lifting weights in the gym. One problem with working out is that after the initial period where you make observable progress almost whatever you do, it is common to plateau. In addition you might not be able to tell if you are making progress because the weights and the time it took to lift them change. Which is better: 10 reps of 80kg in two minutes or 17 reps of 70 kg in three minutes? Power factor gives you a way to evaluate
these two situations and decide whether you have in fact improved.
<br> Power factor is aimed at the person who want to improve their physique but spend as little time doing it as possible. One important consideration for maximum efficiency in the gym is to avoid overtraining. Often people who enjoy weight lifting want to do it more than they should if they want to avoid overtraining. Because the emphasis of power factor is to always try and evaluate your progress from one workout to the next, if you notice that your results are not improving or going backwards then that often indicates that you need more recovery time between workouts.
<br> Lastly, because the power factor workout is time based (usually only 2 minutes or so per exercise) and you perform only 5 exercises per gym visit, the whole workout can be completed very quickly. 
<br> Whether or not the power factor measurement actually tracks some genuine metric is a matter of much debate, but interestingly it doesn't much seem to matter as using the system provides a fun and foucsed way to work out, particularly for those who want to get the strength benefits of lifting weights but are less interested in spending endless hours in the gym achieving those benefits.
<br> The recommended exercises for power factor that give the greatest results for time put in are divided up into two groups with the groups being alternated at each visit to the gym.
